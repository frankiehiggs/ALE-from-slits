    "## Schwarz-Christoffel representation\n",
    "\n",
    "The method comes from [\"A Constructive Method for Numerically Computing Conformal Mappings for Gearlike Domains\"](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/0912013) by Kent Pearce, 1991.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the paper, a *gearlike domain* is the region containing the origin (for us we will want it to contain $\\infty$) bounded by a collection of arcs of circles centred at the origin and by segments of straight lines through the origin. Its logarithm is a periodic polygonal domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the paper's notation, let $A$ be a gearlike domain in the complex plane with $n$ sides. Let $w_k$, $1 \\leq k \\leq n$, denote the vertices of $A$, some of which may lie at infinity (in our case they won't). For each finite vertex $w_k$ let $\\pi \\alpha_k$ denote the interior angle at $w_j$, and let $\\pi \\beta_k$ denote the exterior angle at $w_k$ (the definition of a gearlike domain limits us to $\\beta_k \\in \\{-1,-1/2,0,1/2,1\\}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $f$ be the conformal mapping $\\mathbb{D} \\to A$ with $f(0) = 0$, $f'(0) > 0$. Let $z_k := f^{-1}(w_k) \\in \\partial \\mathbb{D}$.\n",
    "Then the representation formula of Barnard and Pearce is $$\\frac{z f'(z)}{f(z)} = \\prod_{k=1}^n (1 - \\bar z_k z)^{-\\beta_k}.\\tag{1}$$\n",
    "We can \"solve\" this differential equation to write down \"explicitly\" $$f(z) = c z \\exp\\left( \\int_0^z \\frac{ -1 + \\prod_{k=1}^n (1-\\bar z_k w)^{-\\beta_k}}{w}\\mathrm{d}w \\right).\\tag{2}$$\n",
    "So all we need to do is determine the preimages $z_k$ and the parameter $c$ (not so easy but can be done numerically), and then (this also isn't easy) compute that integral."

    "### Determining the preimages\n",
    "\n",
    "If we rotate so that $z_n = 1$, then $c$ is also determined by the preimages. We can solve a system of non-linear equations to determine the remaining preimages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our domain takes a particular form. We'll invert at the very end, so the domain we want to map $\\mathbb{D}$ into is the open unit disc with some slits removed. The slits are determined by their position and length, say $\\theta_1, \\dots, \\theta_k$ and $d_1, \\dots, d_k$. Each slit corresponds to three vertices: its tip and both sides of the base, so we have $n=3k$ vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "The _external_ angle at a tip is $-\\pi$ (since the sum of the internal and external angles must be $\\pi$). The external angle at each base is $\\pi/2$ for the same reason.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let the preimage of slit $j$'s tip be $z^0_{j}$, and the preimage of its bases be $z^{\\pm}_j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without loss of generality, $z^0_k = 1$ (if we're keeping the location of the last tip fixed, then this means we don't have $f'(0) > 0$ any more, but that's ok, we can just rotate at the end).\n",
    "Then if $$w^* := \\exp( \\int_0^1 \\frac{ -1 + \\prod_{m=1}^n (1-\\bar z_m w)^{-\\beta_m}}{w}\\mathrm{d}w )$$and $w_k$ is the location of the last tip, then we have $c = w_k/w^*$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pearce gets $n-2$ non-linear equations which we will solve. We _know_ the locations of the tips and bases $w_m$, and we are solving these equations to find the unknown values of $z_m$. For an _ansatz_ $(z_m)_{1 \\leq m \\leq n-1}$, we compute $\\hat w_m = f(z_m)$ and $n-2$ of our equations are as follows for $1 \\leq m \\leq n-2$:\n",
    "- If $|w_m| = |w_{m-1}|$ (this means that $w_m$ and $w_{m-1}$ are basepoints of adjacent slits), we have one equation $$(\\arg(\\hat w_m) - \\arg(\\hat w_{m-1})) - (\\arg(w_m) - \\arg(w_{m-1})) = 0.\\tag{3c}$$ The right-hand side is the difference in argument between the two attachment points.\n",
    "- If $\\arg(w_m) = \\arg(w_{m-1})$ (this is true if one of $w_m$ and $w_{m-1}$ is a tip so 2/3 of equations have this form), then we have the equation $$|\\hat w_m| - |w_m| = 0.\\tag{3a}$$\n",
    "I believe that in all the above $w_0 := w_n$.\n",

    "We add a final \"equation\" from $$\\sum_{m=1}^n \\beta_m \\arg(z_m) \\equiv 0 \\; (\\mathrm{mod}\\; \\pi).$$ I'm not sure how much trouble the discontinuity in this will cause."

    "#### Solving the non-linear equations\n",
    "\n",
    "Following [Trefethen, 1979](https://www.proquest.com/docview/922000405?parentSessionId=IQLBX47O73EQ9fe%2Bxq01LKARr8cPF0pe%2Fd0FKNtAswo%3D&pq-origsite=primo&accountid=17230&sourcetype=Scholarly%20Journals), we can solve the non-linear system of equations by standard methods after transforming it to an unconstrained problem. Trefethen solved his non-linear equations with a package solver available at the time - I will follow his example and use Scipy's `scipy.optimize.fsolve`. It's important to carefully compute the integral involved in _evaluating_ $f : \\mathbb{D} \\to A$, since this determines how accurately we'll find the preimages of the bases and tips.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The points $(w_m)_{1 \\leq m \\leq n-1}$ are specified by the user.\n",
    "2. We write a function `f(z,params)` computing $f(z ; z_1, ..., z_{n})$. This involves computing a singular integral numerically, including to calculate $c$ as a function of $(w_m)_m$.\n",
    "3. Then we let $$y_m = \\log\\frac{\\varphi_m - \\varphi_{m-1}}{\\varphi_{m+1}-\\varphi_m},$$ for $1 \\leq m \\leq n-1$, where $\\varphi_m := \\arg(z_m)$ and $\\varphi_0 := 0$. Note that these can take any value in $\\mathbb{R}$. We write a function `get_params(ys)` that turns $(y_m)_{1 \\leq m \\leq n-1}$ back into $(z_m)_{1 \\leq m \\leq n-1}$.\n",
    "4. We compute $(\\hat w_m)_{1 \\leq m \\leq n-1}$ using `f` and $(z_m)_{1 \\leq m \\leq n-1}$.\n",
    "5. We calculate the objective function, which returns a vector of length $n-1$. For $1 \\leq m \\leq n-2$, the $m$th entry is the left-hand side of $\\mathrm{(3a)}$ if either of $w_m$ or $w_{m-1}$ is a tip, or $\\mathrm{(3c)}$ otherwise. The final entry is $\\sum_{m=1}^{n} \\beta_m \\arg(z_m) - i\\pi$ where $i$ is chosen such that this value is in $(-\\pi/2, \\pi/2]$. I'm slightly worried about this one, but it might be ok."
